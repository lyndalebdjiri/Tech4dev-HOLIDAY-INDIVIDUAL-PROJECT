# Tech4dev-HOLIDAY-INDIVIDUAL-PROJECT
This repository contains a collection of Python exercises developed during my individual project over the course of Tech4devâ€™s winter break holiday. Each exercise is designed to challenge and improve Python programming skills, covering a wide range of topics. Open discussions and dialogues around the solutions are highly encouraged and welcome.
